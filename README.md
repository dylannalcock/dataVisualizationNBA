The question we are trying to answer: Has the game of basketball, particlularly in the National Basketball Association, become more difficult or has it become easier since the league's coneception in the 1960's?

The National Basketball Association, otherwise known as the NBA, is the pinaccle for any basketball player in terms of competition, skill, and revenue across the world. From a young age, a myriad of young athletes strive to make it to the league and prosper which leads to teams and individuals optimizing their bodies and strategies in whatever way they can. As a result, as with anything in our world, the game has evolved over time and has created an age old debate as to whether or not today's game is more difficult or easy. NBA legends such as Wilt Chamberlain and those who played in the 1960's are often scrutinized as the league was considered less developed, and Chamberlain was the most dominant scorer statistically the game has ever seen. However many argue hsi accomplishments are not as impressive because he was playing against "plumbers" or "construction workers" who are not as skilled as the players we have seen in recent decades. There is even a debate between the difficulty of the game now compared to the 1980's/1990's as people attempt to compare the two greatest players the game of basketball has ever seen, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Our visualizations strive to help answer a variety of statisical questions people may have about the game's evolution, and guide people in helping come to a conclusion in some of these debates.
