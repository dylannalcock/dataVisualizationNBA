    <strong>Context:</strong> The National Basketball Association, otherwise known as the NBA, is the pinaccle for any 
    basketball player in terms of competition, skill, and revenue across the world. From a young age, a myriad of young 
    athletes strive to make it to the league and prosper which leads to teams and individuals optimizing their bodies and 
    strategies in whatever way they can. As a result, as with anything in our world, the game has evolved over time and has created 
    an age old debate as to whether or not today's game is more difficult or easy. NBA legends such as Wilt Chamberlain and those 
    who played in the 1960's are often scrutinized as the league was considered less developed, and Chamberlain was the most dominant 
    scorer statistically the game has ever seen. However many argue hsi accomplishments are not as impressive because he was playing 
    against "plumbers" or "construction workers" who are not as skilled as the players we have seen in recent decades. There is even a 
    debate between the difficulty of the game now compared to the 1980's/1990's as people attempt to compare the two greatest players 
    the game of basketball has ever seen, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Our visualizations strive to help answer a variety of 
    statisical questions people may have about the game's evolution, and guide people in helping come to a conclusion in some of 
    these debates.
  </p>  

  <p><strong>Our Question:</strong> Has the game of basketball, particlularly in the National Basketball Association, become more 
    difficult or has it become easier since the league's coneception in the 1960's? How does one determine if the league is better? We
    can not just look at one statistic - such as average record of the winning team, and determine if the league is better now. We must look
    at multiple points of data to help us analyze how the game now compares to back then.

  <p>One of the first variables we decided to look into to see if the NBA was considered "more competitive" was the total scoring in 
    games of that season. The more scoring there is - the better the league, right? We know the NBA usually has an 82 game regular season.
    In rcent years, there have been some extreme circumstances where the league has not played all 82 games during the regular season, so 
    looking at the total points of that season would not suffice. Instead, we could look at the total points per game of that season to
    see if there was an increase in total amount of points scored per game that season to see on average if teams were improving how many points
    were scored in each game. Up above, you can drag your mouse to see how much points per game were scored each season, and what was projected
    from our model.

  <p> Arguablely the greatest/biggest change to the game of basketball over the decades has been the evolution of the 3 point shot.
    The 3 point line was first introduced to the league in the 1979-1980 season. This provided teams the opportunity to score 3 
    points at once and vastly changed the potential strategies teams could employ in their tactics. Initially, 3 point shooting was 
    relatively scarce as can be seen in the graph. Players and coaches, naturally, found shots closer to the hoop to be more effective
    and reliable in helping teams to win games. Additonally, since it was a new addition to the game players were still learning how to
    utilize the 3 point line to their advantage. Through the years, we can see a steady increase the amount of 3 pointers made and taken.
    It should be noted that there was a 3 year span from 1994-1997 in which the 3 point line was moved from 23 feet to 22 feet in and attempt
    to increase scoring in games. This explains the sharp increase in 3 pointers during that time period. The upwards trend can be explored by playing the animation or 
    choosing a particular year in which you wish to see the progression. Overall, it is clear to see how prominent the 3 point shot has become over time.
    The 3 point shot increases the area of the court players in which players need to play defense, which makes it more difficult to play
    defense well in the today's game. As noted before, prior to 1979 the 3 point shot did not even exist so it is quite apparent that players in the eras before
    were required to provide less coverage across the entire basketball court. Looking solely at the 3 point aspect in the game of basketball and the implications 
    it has on the game, basketball is more difficult now than it was in the past.

  <p>Another very important factor when it comes to professional basketball is a player's physical attributes. There is a reason
    why the average height of NBA players far surpasses that of the average height of the average human. You can toggle between the height
    progression and weight progression of the average NBA player on the graph. From this visualization we can see that the average height and 
    weight has indeed gone up since the conception of the league in the 50's. Althought a 2-3 inch height increase overall seems miniscule, it is 
    actually quite significant. When players are battling for rebounds, going up to block shots, or simply shoot the ball over the outstrecthed arm
    of an opponent, 1 inch makes a world of difference. Weight is also an important factor to take into account here as the weight of a player 
    determines the ability to be able to stand your ground against other oppenents of a similar stature. In terms of weight, the average weight of a player
    has increased by 20 pounds since the start of the league. This means players are not only taller but more muscular as well in 
    comparison to the early eras of the game. From the visualization it is clear to see that players have gotten taller and bigger. 
    With that being said, on the basis of size, players in today's game are much more formidable physically than in the past. This proves to be yet
    another area that entails the increasing level of play in the NBA.
